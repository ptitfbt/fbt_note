facebook comments on page

You don't need to setup Facebook Connect for comments.

You have to first create a Facebook app,
then generate the comments plugin. 
After, put the Javascript code in your application.html.erb 
after the body tag (my suggestion is to make a partial).
In the end, drop the div with the fb-comments class where you want 
the comments box to appear.
